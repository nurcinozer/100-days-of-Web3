<b>Note:</b> I couldn't spend much time for Web3 today because of my school and work. However, I continued to learn some subjects, though in a short time.

# :question: What is a Decentralized Application?

A DApp has:
- A standard front-end
- A Solidity/Solana Backend, built on top of a blockchain

To understand how they communicate, you need to understand Front-end and Backend Development (https://twitter.com/VittoStack/status/1439980841334099971).

I used this post to understand Dapp and its connection with Ethereum: <b>A Guide to Ethereum Dapps</b> (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-dapp-a-guide-to-ethereum-dapps/)

# :pencil: My highlights on this post

- Ethereum removes the need for a third party to handle transactions between peers. Since the middle man is replaced by code, all kinds of costs are reduced, including time and money.
<br />
- Bitcoin removes the need for someone to hold your money, Ethereum removes the need for someone to broker a deal.
<br />
- Smart contracts are essentially hosted on multiple computer nodes all across the world.

## The details of what a Dapp is:
Dapp is just like any other software application you use. It could be a website or an app on your phone. What makes a Dapp different than a traditional app is that it's built on a decentralized network, like Ethereum.

When you're creating your own Ethereum smart contracts, you're actually writing a piece of the backend code for your Dapp. And while your Dapp will have a user interface like a traditional app, either all or part of the backend is built on top of Ethereum.

<b>Dapp = frontend + smart contract backend (Solidity, Serpent or Vyper)</b>

```
pragma solidity ^0.4.22;

contract helloWorld {
 function printHelloWorld () public pure returns (string) {
   return 'Hello World!';
 }
}
```

This is an example of a simple "Hello World" contract written in Solidity (the most popular).

You can use whatever frontend language/framework you want.

:film_strip: After reading this post and taking notes, I started <b>Smart Contracts course</b> available for free on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/smarter-contracts). I watched <b>Why Smart Contracts?</b> video and solved the quiz.
