<b>Note:</b> I couldn't spend much time for Web3 today because of my school and work. However, I continued to learn some subjects, though in a short time.

## :two: Day 2

- I read Vitto Rivabella's tweet about dApp.

- I used this post to understand Dapp and its connection with Ethereum: A Guide to Ethereum Dapps (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-a-dapp-a-guide-to-ethereum-dapps/).
- <b>:rocket: I took notes of what I learned and collected them in Notion.</b>

:film_strip: After reading these posts and taking notes, I started <b>Smart Contracts course</b> available for free on Coursera (https://www.coursera.org/learn/smarter-contracts). I watched <b>Why Smart Contracts?</b> video and solved the quiz.
