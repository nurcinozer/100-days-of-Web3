# Today,

- I completed <a href="https://blog.idrisolubisi.com/build-a-mini-buymeacoffee-dapp-using-solidity-ethereum-smart-contract-reactjs-tailwindcss" target="_blank">this tutorial</a> and pushed the project to my github. You can check out from <a href="https://github.com/nurcinozer/buymeacoffee" target="_blank">here ðŸš€</a>

- Also, I learned what Alchemy is while completing the tutorial. *"Alchemy essentially helps us broadcast our contract creation transaction so that it can be picked up by miners as quickly as possible. Once the transaction is mined, it is then broadcasted to the blockchain as a legit transaction. From there, everyone updates their copy of the blockchain."*

- I started to code <a href="https://buildspace.so/" target="_blank">buildspace projects</a>, and it is really fun ðŸ¤© because the instructor manages to breakdown complex things into simple easy to understand.

- I became active in buildspace's discord server!! I even introduce myself in #introductions channel. It's a big achievement for me because I am usually holding off from doing like things.
