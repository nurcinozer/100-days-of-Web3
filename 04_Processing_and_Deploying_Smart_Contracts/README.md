# :four: Day 4
- I watched Processing Smart Contracts and Deploying Smart Conracts videos on Coursera. But, I think this course is not for me because I prefer to learn by reading rather than watching verbal learning.

- I read "Ethereum İşlem Maliyeti Nedir / Nasıl Hesaplanır ?" by Devrim Danyal.
- I read "How to Get Into Crypto and Web3 as a Developer" by Nader Dabit and it's definitely a great article! :heart_eyes:
- :computer: I ran the examples in Solidity document in Remix IDE.
