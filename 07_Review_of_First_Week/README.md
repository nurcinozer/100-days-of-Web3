# :seven: Day 7

:sparkles: Yay! I just finished my first week on my web3 journey.

First, I repeated what I learned in a week.

In this process, I realized which learning technique was better for me: As <a href="https://twitter.com/edatweets_/status/1483040476995502082" target="_blank">Eda</a> said, "Don't just listen to a podcast or read a blog post. DO IT". At first I read a lot of documentation because I wanted to understand the terms. However, it would have been better for me if I had preferred to understand the terms by doing rather than reading them.

### So what did I DO?
I chose a tutorial from youtube for myself. I finished the first part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLahq4qyors" target="_blank">this 9-hour video</a>. In this first part, I learned to use tools like Truffle, Ganasche and MetaMask. Using Ganasche made it easy for me to understand the structure of the blockchain. I recommend it to everyone!

### What will I DO in the next weeks?
- I will be more active on Twitter. Believe me, this helps a lot to keep up with the technology!
- I will find new tutorial videos. For example, I can watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhZtiytNaBQ
- I want to make Web3 versions of Web2 applications.
- I want to learn NFT.
- I will also spend time reading books and listening to podcasts.
