# Finally, I'm back!

I couldn't continue my **100 Days of Web3** challenge due to my school and exams. Fortunately, I will start producing web3-related contents again with less breaks this time.

Since I will look at different topics every day, I will stop writing topics next to the days in <a href="https://github.com/nurcinozer/100-days-of-Web3#readme" target="_blank">the table</a>.

And here's what I did today:
- I read "How to get started in Web3" by Eda: https://eda.hashnode.dev/how-to-get-started-in-web3
- I read and applied <a href="https://blog.idrisolubisi.com/build-a-mini-buymeacoffee-dapp-using-solidity-ethereum-smart-contract-reactjs-tailwindcss" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>, but I could not complete the tutorial because there is no fake ETH in my wallet. I will continue tomorrow.
