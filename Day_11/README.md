# Today,

- I completed "Build a Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts" buildspace project and pushed to my github. You can check out from <a href="https://github.com/nurcinozer/buildspace-projects/tree/main/my-wave-portal" target="_blank">here 🚀</a>.

- Also, if you look at the repository you will realize I create a repository for buildspace projects. I will share buildspace projects that I build in <a href="https://github.com/nurcinozer/buildspace-projects" target="_blank">that repository</a>.

- I gained <a href="https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0x3cd266509d127d0eac42f4474f57d0526804b44e/14454/" target="_blank">my first NFT</a> from buildspace since I have finished the first project.

- I became a member of buildspace women channel!! 🍋💛
